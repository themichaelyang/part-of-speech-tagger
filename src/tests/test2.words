a
similar

program
for
youth
conservation
(
a
la
Sen.
Chris
Dodd
)
,
a
competitive
grants
program
to
states
to
spark
youth
and
senior
citizen
volunteer
projects
(
a
Kennedy
specialty
)
,
a
community
service
work-study
program
for
students
(
pleasing
to
the
palate
of
Sen.
Dale
Bumpers
,
among
others
)
,
plus
engorgement
of
the
VISTA
volunteer
program
and
the
