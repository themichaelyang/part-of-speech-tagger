Chomsky Normal Form:

A -> AB
A -> terminal
C -> empty str

English is Context Free, but we can convert it to CNF

we need it in CNF for our algorithm (more useful form)

0: the
1: mean
2: duck
3: quacked
4: menacingly
5

[0,2] = the mean
[1,4] = mean duck quacked
[3,5] = quacked menacingly

For rules: X -> YZ
If Y = [a,b] & Z = [b,c], then X = [a,c]

## Will be on midterm!!!

Top down is a potential problem (infinite parse)
NP -> NP PP
      NP -> NP PP
            NP -> NP PP
                  ...

Head of a phrase: word that determines the category of the phrase

We have to be careful; no crossing branches in the tree structure

"The type was too small to read"

too, small, read --> want to cross branches
